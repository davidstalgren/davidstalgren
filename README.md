- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidstalgren and I'm very pleased to see you here!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in webdesign and software development. Also interested in some hardware aspect of computers.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Testing with Jest and Cypress in my Frontend development studies and much more learning there will be.
What have we done sofar you say? Well We started with **HTML** and **CSS** in October last year. A couple of weeks with that and we later dove head first into **JavaScript**. 
For the longest time I thought drowning was the new thing, because that was what it felt like. Anxiety like never before! Pushed through and came out the other side with new found knowledge in both JavaScript and some **TypeScript**. After that there was a shorter course in graphic tools and interface design. Played around with **Figma** but also some photo editing was present. Also got to get a little taste of my first JS framework **Vue** in there too.

Looking for LIA for weeks 43-52 the fall of 2023.
